      <h1 style="font-size: 50px; color:red;">var, let and const</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 25px; color:blue;">
        var, let and const are keywords of JS. It allows us to declear a
        variable. But there is a little bit difference among them. var is a
        functional scope variable declearation while let and const are block
        scope variable declearation. let is changeable within the block but
        const is not changeable it is fixed.

      <h1 style="font-size: 50px; color:red;">use cases of null and undefined</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 25px; color:blue;">
        null means absence of value. If we do not know initial value of a
        variable then we can assign null value, and can update it when required.
        undefined is a state where the compiler is not finding the variable or a
        function, it may be one kind of error while declearing variable or
        function.
